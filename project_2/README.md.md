**Project 2**
**BIOS 611**
**FALL 2019**

**Background Description**

Urban Ministries of Durham assist around 6,000 people each year who need food, shelter, clothing and/or supportive services. Some of the programs that they offer is a (1) community shelter where people are given a place to sleep and assistance to help them find a home, a (2) Community Caf√© serves three meals a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, and a (3) food and clothing closet for those that either need food or clothing. Donations, just to as any homeless shelter, are important to maintain services, therefore communicating the importance of donations should be a high priority.

**Motivation**

One of the major services that homeless-shelters provide, just as Urban Ministries of Durham, is to provide food to those that need it. For this reason, this project will keep to create a Shiny that will allow the user to retrieve insightful statistics about the past on the number of meals provide per the requested timeline.

**Approach**

The proposed shiny will have a box-plot graph of the recorded number of meals per month for a selected month. From this level there will be a summary on the record max, record min, average of min and max, and the average number of meals. Additionally, the user will be able to select a specific day from that month from which the same statistics will be provided for that specific day. 

Having this tool to retrieve information can be useful while deciding how much food to prepare on festive days or just on a regular day.
